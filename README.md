# CalfFecalMicrobiome

The study focused on a longitudinal study of the calf fecal microbiome from their arrival to the farm until 112 days. During this period, the 60 animals were treated divided in two treatment groups probiotic (SCFP) and control. Fecal samples were collected on the days 0, 28, 56, 84 and 112 for the microbiome analysis.
